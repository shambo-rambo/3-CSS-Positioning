# Single-Page Website Wireframing Guide

# Choosing Your Topic

Before starting your wireframe, choose a topic you're passionate about. This could be:

* Your favorite hobby (skateboarding, painting, photography)
* A music genre or artist you love
* A sport or team you follow

# What is Wireframing?

Wireframing is creating a basic skeleton or blueprint of your website before development. Think of it as sketching your ideas before painting. A wireframe focuses on:

* Layout and structure of sections
* Content placement and hierarchy
* Basic user interface elements
* Navigation flow
* Core functionality

# Why Wireframe?

Wireframing helps you:

* Visualize your website structure before coding
* Identify potential usability issues early
* Save time during development
* Ensure a cohesive design across sections
* Focus on user experience without getting distracted by colors and fancy design elements
